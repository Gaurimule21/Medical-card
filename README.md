# Medical-card
Problem Statement:
Traditional paper-based medical records pose several challenges, including mismanagement, data loss, retrieval delays, and security risks. Healthcare providers need a centralized digital solution where patient information, medical history, and prescriptions can be securely stored, updated, and accessed in real time. The Medical Card System addresses these challenges by offering a secure, web-based platform for managing patient health records efficiently.

Project Summary:
The Medical Card System is a web-based application designed to store, manage, and retrieve patient medical records. It provides doctors, patients, and healthcare providers with an organized way to access health details, improving efficiency in medical decision-making.

Key features of the system:
✔ User Authentication – Secure login for patients and doctors with role-based access.
✔ Medical Record Management – Patients can store and retrieve their medical history, prescriptions, and reports.
✔ Appointment Scheduling – Doctors can manage appointments and patient treatment history.
✔ Data Security & Access Control – Ensures medical records are accessed only by authorized users.
✔ Real-time Data Processing – Enables quick access and updates to medical records.

The system enhances data accuracy, security, and accessibility, replacing paper records with a secure digital alternative.
